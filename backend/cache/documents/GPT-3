two thousand twenty text generating language model Generative Pre trained Transformer three GPT three large language model released OpenAI 2020. Like predecessor GPT two decoder two transformer model deep neural network supersedes recurrence convolution based architectures technique known attention. three This attention mechanism allows model selectively focus segments input text predicts relevant. four GPT three one hundred seventyfive billion parameters sixteen bit precision thus requiring 350GB storage space parameter takes two bytes space.  context window size two thousand fortyeight tokens demonstrated strong zero shot shot learning abilities many tasks. two  September twentytwo two thousand twenty Microsoft announced licensed GPT three exclusively. Others still receive output public API Microsoft access underlying model. five Background edit According The Economist improved algorithms powerful computers recent increase amount digitized material fueled revolution machine learning. New techniques 2010s resulted rapid improvements tasks including manipulating language. six Software models trained learn using thousands millions examples structure... loosely based neural architecture brain. six One architecture used natural language processing NLP neural network based deep learning model introduced 2017the transformer architecture. seven There number NLP systems capable processing mining organizing connecting contrasting textual input well correctly answering questions. eight  June eleven two thousand eighteen OpenAI researchers engineers published paper introducing first generative pre trained transformer GPT type generative large language model pre trained enormous diverse text corpus datasets followed discriminative fine tuning focus specific task. GPT models transformer based deep learning neural network architectures. Previously best performing neural NLP models commonly employed supervised learning large amounts manually labeled data made prohibitively expensive time consuming train extremely large language models. two The first GPT model known GPT one followed GPT two February 2019. Created direct scale predecessor GPT two parameter count dataset size increased factor .  .  billion parameters trained dataset eight million web pages. nine  February two thousand twenty Microsoft introduced Turing Natural Language Generation T NLG claimed largest language model ever published seventeen billion parameters. ten  performed better language model variety tasks including summarizing texts answering questions. Training capabilities edit A sample student essay pedagogy written GPT three The construct learning styles problematic fails account processes learning styles shaped. Some students might develop particular learning style particular experiences. Others might develop particular learning style trying accommodate learning environment well suited learning needs. Ultimately need understand interactions among learning styles environmental personal factors shape learn kinds learning experience. Text generated Mike Sharples eleven  May twentyeight two thousand twenty arXiv preprint group thirtyone engineers researchers OpenAI described achievement development GPT three third generation state art language model. one twelve The team increased capacity GPT three two orders magnitude predecessor GPT two thirteen making GPT three largest non sparse language model date. one fourteen fourteen Because GPT three structurally similar predecessors one greater accuracy attributed increased capacity greater number parameters. fifteen GPT three capacity ten times larger Microsoft Turing NLG next largest NLP model known time. twelve Lambdalabs estimated hypothetical cost around .  million  dollars three hundred fiftyfive years train GPT three single GPU two thousand twenty sixteen lower actual training time using GPUs parallel. Sixty percent weighted pre training dataset GPT three comes filtered version Common Crawl consisting four hundred ten billion byte pair encoded tokens. one nine Other sources nineteen billion tokens WebText2 representing twentytwo weighted total twelve billion tokens Books1 representing eight fiftyfive billion tokens Books2 representing eight three billion tokens Wikipedia representing three. one nine GPT three trained hundreds billions words also capable coding CSS JSX Python among others. citation needed GPT three training data one nine Dataset tokens Proportion within training Common Crawl four hundred ten billion sixty WebText2 nineteen billion twentytwo Books1 twelve billion eight Books2 fiftyfive billion eight Wikipedia three billion three Since GPT three training data encompassing require training distinct language tasks. citation needed The training data contains occasional toxic language GPT three occasionally generates toxic language result mimicking training data. A study University Washington found GPT three produced toxic language toxicity level comparable similar natural language processing models GPT two CTRL. OpenAI implemented several strategies limit amount toxic language generated GPT . As result GPT three produced less toxic language compared predecessor model GPT one although produced generations higher toxicity toxic language compared CTRL Wiki language model trained entirely Wikipedia data. seventeen  June eleven two thousand twenty OpenAI announced users could request access user friendly GPT three APIa machine learning toolset help OpenAI explore strengths limits new technology. eighteen nineteen The invitation described API general purpose text text interface complete almost English language task instead usual single use case. eighteen According one user access private early release OpenAI GPT three API GPT three eerily good writing amazingly coherent text simple prompts. twenty  initial experiment eighty  subjects asked judge short two hundred word articles written humans GPT .
